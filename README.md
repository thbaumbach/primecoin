What is Primecoin?
------------------

Primecoin is an experimental cryptocurrency that introduces the first
scientific computing proof-of-work to cryptocurrency technology. Primecoin's
proof-of-work is an innovative design based on searching for prime number
chains, providing potential scientific value in addition to minting and
security for the network. Similar to Bitcoin, Primecoin enables instant payments
to anyone, anywhere in the world. It also uses peer-to-peer technology to
operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are
carried out collectively by the network. Primecoin is also the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Primecoin client sofware, see http://primecoin.org.
